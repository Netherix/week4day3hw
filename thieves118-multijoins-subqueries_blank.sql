-- MULTI JOIN
-- NOTE: Its good practice to do no more than 3 joins in a multijoin.
-- Start from the actor table, join to the film_actor table, join to the film table


-- Subqueries
-- You can use subqueries 3 different ways
-- SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses

-- WHERE is the most common
-- SELECT is the most uncommon

-- Query 1: Find all customer_ids that have spent more than $175



-- Query 2: Get all customer info


-- NOW our subquery to combine them together using WHERE and IN

-- Another Subquery Example (adding joins)
-- query first_name, last_name actors that worked on the movie "Mulan Moon"
